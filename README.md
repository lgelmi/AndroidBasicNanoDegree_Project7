No major improvement respect to the requirement has been made. Here's the main extra features:
* Random book generation: Random book data can be generated to debug the application. 
* Wipe Clean: The Database can be completely cleaned to start fresh.
* Helper Improvement: the database interaction methods have been added to the helper which can serve as a complete DB utility.

**N.B.:** The /Credits.txt file stores all resource original sources.
